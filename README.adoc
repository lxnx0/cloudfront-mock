## Running

To build, from the root directory run:

    mvn clean package

Once built you can deploy cloudfront-mock-web-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war to your app server.
This has been tested with Wildfly 10.x but should work on any Web Profile app server.

There is a sample configuration file called sample-config.properties

	root=/path/to/your/root/directory
	keys=key1,key2
	key.key1.location=/path/to/key1.pem
	key.key2.location=/path/to/key2.pem

*root*: the directory where your assets you want to serve are located +
*keys*: a list of pem keys you wish to give access to the root content. At lease 1 key is required. +
*key.key1.location*: an example of how to set the file path of where the application can find key1.

To run Wildfly with this config file simply pass in the following environment variable:

	./standalone.sh -Dapp.cfmock.env=/path/to/sample-config.properties

once deployed you should be able to use signed URLs against the context root of the applicaiton:

	http://127.0.0.1:8080/cloudfront-mock-web-1.0-SNAPSHOT/path/to/resource.html?Expires=13570344005&Signature=nitfHRCrtziwO2HwPfWw~yYDhUF5EwRunQA-j19DzZrvDh6hQ73lDx~-ar3UocvvRQVw6EkC~GdpGQyyOSKQim-TxAnW7d8F5Kkai9HVx0FIu-5jcQb0UEmatEXAMPLE3ReXySpLSMj0yCd3ZAB4UcBCAqEijkytL6f3fVYNGQI66&Key-Pair-Id=APKA9ONS7QCOWEXAMPLE
